**Ctrl/Command** + click to open a link in a new window

The project is a password generator app that allows users to choose the length of the password, generate and copy the generated password by clicking corresponding buttons. It was made made with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`.

 ### In creating this project, I practiced several skills, including:
  * Working with the Document Object Model and interacting with DOM elements;
  * Handling JavaScript events;
  * Conditionally adding styles to elements via JavaScript;
  * Creating custom elements such as a slider;
  * Importing fonts from Google Fonts etc.
